However, this video explains it much better than I could ever do.\n\n[https://youtu.be/1bCLqzL-bgY?si=NZ8bzkf0mbIG3Qx3](https://youtu.be/1bCLqzL-bgY?si=NZ8bzkf0mbIG3Qx3)\n\nThe key for improving the math score is to check everything multiple times. My advice would be to do all the calculations yourself, then you should use DESMOS to check. Use DESMOS to CHECK, not to do it. This is because I sometimes make mistakes where I plug something into DESMOS wrong, like maybe typed in a number wrong. Then I would skip that question when reviewing because \"I plugged it into DESMOS, and DESMOS is never wrong\", and that would always make me get some question wrong.\n\n  \nYou can plug almost anything into DESMOS, including quadratics, systems of equations and basically most questions.\n\nIf you want to find the mean or median of a data set, type this into DESMOS. mean(data point 1, point 2, point 3).\n\nThe only questions that you cant solve with DESMOS are geometry questions. For those questions, you should draw out the shapes- even if they're drawn for you- so you could work on them.\n\nFinally, at the end, don't take a break, keep reviewing the questions until time runs out. If I didn't do this, I wouldn't have gotten a perfect 800 on the math.",

The most complete way to study for SAT without a tutor or anything I think really is just go through everything on Khan Academy, skimming the parts that you're 100% sure you already have a good grasp of. It's a heck ton of stuff yes but if you lock in at it for \\~an hour a day it really shouldn't take that long to go through everything. After that do the Bluebook tests if you haven't, or if you have, I found about 3 random dsat practice tests online (just google like \"digital sat practice test free\") that seemed not bad. Do those spaced apart and use them as checkpoints to see where you are and what you need to improve. Between those do questions from SAT question bank for topics that you're weaker with.",

Furthermore, there's also a list for root words + affixes. I highly recommend that you check it out. It's free. \n\n•Complete the Erica Meltzer books (Grammar + Reading). Make notes on grammar rules and different strategies. \n\n•Watch grammar and strategy videos by Settele Tutoring on YouTube.

            "I really recommend using Desmos. It really helped me get through the second module. I think I had roughly 15 minutes left for the last 2 questions, thanks to desmos. Every time you see a question with “equivalent”, “… in terms of ….”, “x,y solution”, “constant”, a graph translation question, or a question that asks you to find f(x) using 2 points, you should systemically think of desmos. \n\nOther than that, I recommend using the educator question bank to practice- it helps a ton. I found many repeating questions on the August SAT.\n\nLastly, my advice would be to never neglect other easier questions. They are even more important than the harder ones as they could cost you up to 30 points compared to 10 points if you made a mistake on the harder question. Be sure to double check, even if it costs you the time to answer one hard question.",

Most of the preparation was on reading b/c I suck at that and my math was alright so i didn't worry much. \n\n1. [vocabtest.com](http://vocabtest.com) --> this site is so good because it has lots of vocab that have been seen on past tests and things. If you can do everything from 8th grade to AP Senior level, you will be 110% ready for the vocab they throw at you. \n\n2. Settele Tutoring Videos: I started to watch him late in my preparation because he is one of the best resources i have used for reading and writing. He approaches each question with lots of thought and process and generalizes some patterns. I would also recommend 3-4-5 tutoring for patterns in data evidence questions and text completions. Dumb Summaries are by far the most useful concept for reading i have learned. \n\n4. Starting at q15 - q27 and then doing the reading. This is timesaver. It should take around 30-45 seconds per question and then that will leave lots of time to do the hard questions around q11-q15. \n\nHope somebody can use these tips and improve their scores.

            "The new Digital SAT emphasizes understanding claims + evidence or cause + effect, especially in experimental design. There are a lot of passages about evolutionary biology, archaeology, and consumer economics. Reading nonfiction essays and articles about studies, experiments, and discoveries will be especially helpful for building these skills. \n\nListening to podcasts can also be a good way to strengthen skills in evaluating claims + evidence or cause + effect! While listening to podcasts doesn’t involve all of the same skills as reading, you’ll still absorb thinking patterns and even vocabulary while listening. Look for podcasts that interview scientists, researchers, and other academic experts — these are more likely to have the kind of language and structured arguments that align with the SAT. One of my favorites is “In Our Time” from the BBC; each episode interviews a different set of three academic experts on a specific topic (including history, science, literature, and the arts).\n\nHere’s some specific magazines and journals that I've recommended for my own students as sources for reading more material. Some of them are written for a general (though educated) audience, like *The New Yorker, Smithsonian Magazine,* or *The Atlantic*. Others (marked with a \\*) are written for an academic audience, like the pre-eminent academic journals *Science* and *Nature*. \n\n**Recommended sources for articles and essays** ***without*** **a paywall:**\n\n* *Smithsonian Magazine*\n* *The Guardian* (especially the Science section or *The Long Read*)\n* *Scientific American*\n* *Aeon*\n* *Quanta Magazine*\n* *Science News* (partial paywall)\n* *\\*PLOS Journals* (several peer-reviewed open-access journals)\n* *\\*BioMed Central*\n* *\\*Open Library of Humanities*\n* *\\*Annual Review of Political Science*\n\n**Recommended sources for articles and essays behind a paywall:**\n\n* *The New Yorker*\n* *The Atlantic*\n* *The New York Times* (especially the Science section)\n* *The Economist*\n* *Foreign Policy*\n* *National Geographic*\n* *\\*Nature*\n* *\\*Science*\n* *\\*Past & Present*\n* *\\*The Journal of Economic History*\n* *\\*The American Historical Review*\n* *\\*Media, Culture & Society*\n* *\\*American Political Science Review*",

            "Your study plan really depends on where you're at. People who got 700+ right away have a very different study plan than people who started in the 500's but worked their way up. Let me explain:\n\nGetting 700+ on Math means you are probably missing only the hardest problems, so meticulous review of your mistakes is key. When you get a question wrong, figure out not only what the right answer is, but be completely certain why every other answer choice is individually wrong. Do the same thing for the questions you got right.\n\nEnglish 500's means you probably have some knowledge gaps, so you should fill those with the right instruction in addition to practice. Look at which questions you're missing the most - is it grammar, reading comprehension, logic, interpreting graphs, etc.? From there, find a good program that will explain the right strategies for that and give you problems at your difficulty level (you're probably looking to solve easy/medium problems first). Then take it from there.\n\nGood luck!"

More applicants + limited spots = lower acceptance rates. Sure, that’s not the only reason, but to say it played no role at all?

If your state doesn't fund lower income students, you can thank the voting population of your state for not supporting those types of policies.\n\nI think part of the problem on this board is you have students who have literally never had to want for anything.  Need a school?  Private high end prep with experienced counselors.  Like a sport?  Here's some private coaching.  Like science?  Oh mommy knows a PhD down at FancySchoolLab.  Want to apply to college?  Let's hire an advisor.\n\nThen we have all brands of middle and lower class students posting here too.  They don't always have a good sense on how finances work coming into the process.  The first group has no self awareness on their privlege.  The latter sometimes get carried away with marketing from schools and believing this is a true meritocracy (hint, it most definitely is not).  Some students who NEED substantial aid to attend at all know all too well.  \n\nWhen you are a high school student focused on high school things you are just oblivious to a lot of things that are not in your immediate bubble.  Why are you surprised people don't know everything, especially outside their own experience.  I work with students, and I find students that come out of urban, socio economically diverse schools that are academically motivated to be a bit more ... wordly than most.\n\nIf you cannot afford your public flagship for 4 years, consider reseraching starting up living at home and doing CC for 2 years and how transfers work from your closest CC.  Or look into commute from home options.  Housing is the thing that really costs and colleges have a hard time doing anything about.  Room and board costs money.

Between my wife and I (both women) we have dealt with a divorce, a miscarriage, pregnancies, saying goodbye to foster kids, adopting foster kids and dealing with their traumas (side note but this will make you realize how good you have it), the majority of my wife's family going no contact because she got divorced from a man to marry a woman, one of our kids being diagnosed with T1D, another one of our kids being diagnosed with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and being born dependent on drugs due to her birth mom's choices. Watching an infant going through drug withdrawal is awful. Watching your adopted preschooler play court with their stuffed animals to process their trauma is horrible. Watching your adopted teens realize that their birth parents aren't putting in the work to keep them is heartbreaking. \n\nYou know what wasn't so bad though? Getting rejected from my dream school. Going to Stony Brook instead of Duke didn't mean that much in the long run. Don't let one rejection ruin your life. This won't be the worst thing you go through and getting accepted into your dream school won't be the best thing you ever go through. Despite all of the challenges we have in life, I am happy with my life and all 7 of my kids. This is better than Duke.",
            "Yes to all of this!\n\nWhen applying to highly-selective colleges, I think the idea of a “dream school” is ultimately pretty harmful. \n\nIf your “dream school” is a target or safety for you and the admit rate is over 30%, that’s one thing. If you’re probably going to be admitted, you can spend years dreaming about going there.\n\nBut pinning all of your dreams on **one** ultra-selective school with an admit rate of 1 in 20 students? Especially if it’s mostly because of the prestige and you don’t actually know that much about the school? That’s a recipe for a big psychological blow.\n\nObviously there are a lot of things that you can do to improve your application and increase your chances, but there will always be an element of luck at the most selective schools. Every year I work with really strong applicants, and I can feel pretty optimistic that if they apply to a collection of highly-selective schools that they have a high chance of being admitted to at least some of them. It’s hard to predict, though, if those acceptances will come from Harvard vs Brown vs Duke.\n\nThere are absolutely differences between different highly-selective schools, and it’s good to craft your list thoughtfully to match what matters to you — you don’t need to necessarily blindly apply to every T20. But I think getting attached to *one* ultra-selective school, the way that characters in TV shows do, can be unwise.",

It's an amazing school that really cares about its students. Pretty much all of us ( that I know) went onto grad school or became very successful.

To say he didn't get in because he is Indian and his parents are of Indian origin (but not of privilege) is complete non-sense. Harvard's acceptance rate is approximately 4%, which means that 96 out of every 100 highly qualified, deserving applicants are rejected. Focus on the positive instead of wasting your time with this victim mentality.",

The only way you could be so terribly upset at not winning is if you had completely irrational expectations.\n\nOf course, knowing that doesn’t necessarily help a mother console her son, because telling him “you shouldn’t feel bad because you never should have expected to be admitted to Harvard in the first place” would the exact WRONG thing in this situation.\n\nThat said, you are correct that re-applying after a gap year is completely unlikely to yield a different outcome at Harvard (or any similar school) and would likely encourage even MORE inappropriate expectations — “This time I WILL have a chance.”\n\nPerhaps the move is to encourage him to start at Vassar with the best effort possible and be open to transferring somewhere else in a year or so? This may get him off in the right foot, wanting to succeed at Vassar, etc.  The worst case scenario is that he ends up liking Vassar and stays there.\n\nGood luck — and you’re a good mom for wanting to help him realize his dreams!"

I give it to all my students but I especially focus on it for my students who can only come up with fairly “boring” topics that won’t help to differentiate them from other students. \n\nOne thing I’d also add is that the common app topics tend to fall into two broad categories: your history/background and ideas that fascinate you. For kids who have “no story to tell” and “I’ve got no hook” but are otherwise smart and want to get into top schools especially, I think the “ideas that fascinate me”\ntopics are underrated. I had a student write an excellent one last year about quantum computing (make sure it’s still about *you* though). *Hacking the College Essay* mentions them a few times but I feel like they could have covered them more and talked through how students can develop those ideas. Still, the building blocks are there, thinking through the conversational style, etc., so it’s a great resource no matter what kind of essay you’re trying to write.\n\nAgain, it really helps increase your potential of writing a genuinely good rather than merely “fine”  essay.",

            "Start by discussing budget/need for financial aid with your parents.  Sit down with them — with their tax returns and financial statements in-hand — and complete the Net Price Calculator for a few schools you think you might be interested in. There’s no sense in starting to think about schools without any idea what you can realistically afford.\n\nAs for setting your sights on Ivy League schools:  with your interest in engineering or CS, keep in mind that there’s not as much overlap between the Ivy League and “top engineering/CS schools” as you might imagine.  So be sure to keep an open mind as you look for schools, especially because a 3.7 GPA and a 29 ACT with limited/no EC’s ain’t gonna cut it when applying for Ivies. (Or most non-Ivy top engineering/CS schools either, for that matter.)\n\nAs for starting a non-profit… there’s no better way to get the admissions officer reading your application to roll their eyes and wonder “*why the hell did this kid waste the time, effort, money, resources etc starting a NEW organization, rather that volunteering with an existing organization that is already up-and-running and actually making a difference?*”",
            "If you want to major in CS, it might be helpful to learn a language—Python, probably. Take the chance over this summer to watch a few YouTube tutorials and figure out if you like it. If you do, see if there are any comp sci clubs at your school and join (or make one!)",
            "I suggest a High Academic college or University - A Wake Forrest or Vanderbilt, etc. and those are a stretch as you still need a 4.0.  The reality is that without a 4.0 plus and tons of extra-curriculars, you have no shot of going to an Ivy League School.  The extra-curricular really needed to start from day 1, not just finding things after your JR. year.  Everyone and I mean Everyone at Ivy's got straight A's in highs School,  No A minus  certainly no B's as well as close to perfect SAT or ACT scores.  Plus most have been taking every possible AP class available to them from Freshman year where that's possible.  My son is a straight A student, every A in every class since Freshman year and was talking about Ivy schools for Engineering,  his mother, a Harvard PHD, told him without massive amounts of Extra Curricular's, there was no way.  So he's looking next tier down because between Varsity Sports and Competitive Band, which are all year round, he has no time for Key Club and Habitat for Humanity type pursuits, etc, nor does he have interest in joining them just to say he did.  You mention being a white guy, but don't think getting in is easier for minorities, they also have extremely high academic qualifications, anything else said about that is propaganda or sour grapes, schools may look at those demographics to fill spots, but they aren't filling them with less qualified applicants.  -  Last piece of advice, work really hard and prepare yourself for college, wherever you go, it really isn't that important to go ivy before grad school,  in fact, the schools really have their reputations because of their post degree programs, not their undergrad.  So go somewhere good, do well then apply for Grad or Post Grad at an Ivy."

It’s a 35 page booklet but it’s intensely helpful. I give it to all my students but I especially focus on it for my students who can only come up with fairly “boring” topics that won’t help to differentiate them from other students. \n\nOne thing I’d also add is that the common app topics tend to fall into two broad categories: your history/background and ideas that fascinate you. For kids who have “no story to tell” and “I’ve got no hook” but are otherwise smart and want to get into top schools especially, I think the “ideas that fascinate me”\ntopics are underrated. I had a student write an excellent one last year about quantum computing (make sure it’s still about *you* though). *Hacking the College Essay* mentions them a few times but I feel like they could have covered them more and talked through how students can develop those ideas. Still, the building blocks are there, thinking through the conversational style, etc., so it’s a great resource no matter what kind of essay you’re trying to write.\n\nAgain, it really helps increase your potential of writing a genuinely good rather than merely “fine”  essay.",

I usually post a list throughout the spring on A2C.\n\nSUREFIRE SUREBET WELCOMING SCHOOL: Make sure you have a SureFire School.

Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Waiting for those acceptances can be brutal. Breathe.

I sometimes submit to one competition - not get any award - and then get an award for the same artwork in another. Art is super subjective, so submitting your artworks to multiple competitions will be helpful! Like OP said, do your research to find contests. Art competitions are usually only once a year, so you really don't want to miss a chance!\n\nAlso, submitting art portfolios can actually be pretty time consuming because the colleges all have different requirements. Some only accept really small file sizes, and if you are submitting a video for example, it can be pretty time consuming to make your file smaller.

            "As a graduate of an “elite” college (only top 40, but probably on OP’s list) and “elite” PhD program (ivy, but that’s not important for grad school), and as a former hiring manager, I would like to push back on the elite v non elite binary. While I agree that there is an edge whose value varies by field, it is by no means this black and white. First, because your actual accomplishments will always trump the name of your institution - it is cliche but true that college is what you make of it. \n\nBut also because he leaves out an important category: state. It is an open secret among employers and admissions officers that many of the best of the best come from state. The graduates of the elites are usually smart (not always, I’ve known astonishing dumbasses at ivy) but also disproportionately privileged, and sometimes entitled. \n\nState is more of a mixed bag. Lots of brilliant teens with amazing potential don’t make it to an elite for all sorts of reasons - financial, family, health, resources, opportunities, mediocre high school, or maybe just an ordinary working class culture that doesn’t dream of Harvard because college itself is enough of a dream. Most of these end up at their state flagship. But cream rises to the top, and the ones who prove themselves at state tend to be very good bets and very desirable hires. \n\nSo sure, go to an elite if you can and you think you will do well and be happy there. (Being happy is an underrated component of becoming successful.) But there are many roads to success so don’t panic if an elite college is not the first stop on your path. Just accomplish something. Much of OP’s advice will work at a college of any ranking.",

I want to redeem myself and really take everything into my hands and commit myself to academics next year, as well as extracurriculars. I plan on taking AP Chem, AP Gov, and AP Stats for my Junior year. Along with Spanish IV, a mandatory social studies class, and two semester long english classes, I should have 6/8 blocks filled for each semester. I was hoping to keep it this way, to ensure I have enough time to meet with teachers as well as do work and not feel swamped aferschool. Would this count as a \"rigorous\" class setup? I'm afraid having two free blocks will devalue my workload/schedule and make it seem like a rather easy one. On the contrary, I'm afraid if I fill even one of those blocks, I might start struggling too much and grades will drop significantly. Can someone give me some advice?"

Be comfortable with yourself and work hard for your own future. Wear what you want to school so that you are the most comfortable, as long as it's appropriate. I wore pajamas pants to school 90% of the time as a senior. I felt more at ease. Ask the dumb questions. Someone probably has it too and they'll thank you for it. Be proactive in what your are interested in and don't fall back. Socialize with your teachers, even if it's super hard, try and don't feel embarrassed. Get over past mistakes and realize you're probably the only one who still remembers/thinks about it.\n\nA lot of these things are why in junior year I went from straight As to mostly Cs. My intelligence had met its mark and my natural abilities weren't enough to just show up to class and that's it. Senior year got back to straight As with a complete course load of APs and dual enrollment and have maintained it in college(luckily).\n\nA lot of the ppl in this sub are smart and gifted and are used to not needing to put in a lot of effort. Trust me, there will be a day that it catches up to you, it has happened to every single one of my friends and siblings. The only thing is when and if you can prevent it.

There are also plenty of stories about colleges doing random checks to prevent people from lying.

            "The best essays don’t need a special story , they need a normal story told in a special way. \n\nWhen I took AP lang, the first month of the class was dedicated to us learning how to write college essays. The secret to a good essay is to pick a story that’s tells something interesting about you, and tell it in a special way.  You like playing the piano? Write the story from the perspective of the Piano! Want to talk about how much you love tennis. Tell a story about how you went from a nervous little boy or girl to now helping nervous little boys and girl learn about the sport you love.\n\nTaking to an actual Georgia Tech admissions officer, the greatest essay she ever read was about goats. Try using a medium that isn’t you to talk about yourself",
            "Both my kids followed the advice to make the essay about a  \"slice of life\". It seemed to work, as they were both admitted to top-10 colleges.\n\nBy \"slice of life\", I mean write about a small event that reveals much about you. For an athlete, it could be the ritual beforehand to get you into the right frame of mind, rather than describing the \"big game\" or summarizing your athletic accomplishments. For an artist, it could be about the process of creating just one painting, rather than summarizing all the artwork created to date.",
            "Hi! Just finished the 2023 admissions cycle, and I didn’t really have a lot of guidance aside from the first 3 pages of google when you search, “How to write college essay”. Here are some things that I picked up along the way which allowed me to write something that I was proud of:\n\nAbove all, your essay is who you are. If your college application is an art gallery, your essay is the largest, most beautiful painting. You want to use your essay to connect to your admissions officer, to convince them that you belong at that college. Your essay should be personable, it should humanize your application. It brings flavor and color to an otherwise relatively monochrome packet of paper. \n\nOne great way to personalize your essay is through anecdotes, or stories. These glimpses into your life should highlight personal qualities of yours that you want to shine through (Ex: leadership, perseverance, determination, etc.). Again, the primary goal of this is to reach your admissions officer and convince them that you belong to their school. \n\nI think a great way to do this is to almost pretend like you’re talking to someone. Keep things simple, and straight to the point. No one likes someone who blabs on and on about the same thing. Don’t drag the essay out if you don’t have enough to take about. Sometimes less is more. This goes without saying but, if you have enough to fill your essay out, go straight ahead.\n\nThis may seem obvious, but make sure you’re careful with your writing. Avoid grammar and spelling mistakes, as you don’t want your AO to think you’re being careless on what is likely one of the most important essays of your life up to this point. Make sure every word is intentional. Don’t use big words for the sake of using them, every word has its own unique, specific meaning meant for certain contexts. \n\nTo avoid going on for much longer, I’ll add one last point. Make sure to get your essay reviewed. Ask people you trust have your best interest in mind, and who will take good care in actually going through your whole essay. \n\nTo anyone who actually took the time to read this, thank you, and good luck!",
            "From a comment a made a while back:\n\nImma past something I said for a chance me and it may help you maybe: “ I think the thing my senior friends have helped me realize is you want the AO’s to read your stuff and have a combo of the following at the end of all your essays and recs and stuff:\n\n-this kid deserves to go here (more so academically is capable)\n\n-this kid won’t fall into a void when things get hard and flunk out\n\n-this kid is…(name something noticeable that YOU will contribute to their campus)… and WE want that here\n\n-I want this kid to go here!\n\nThe last one is the hardest to unlock, you need to have all of the ones before the last one unlocked to get to the final fruit and boss (this is really like a video game tbh).\n\nYour goal is to win the AO’s over, you need stats, but you also need to give them a personal quality and charisma so much so that they GLADLY WANT to be YOUR personal advocate. These AO’s are first veters—they make sure no red flags are seen, and if partially shown in an essay you have resolved it and have come back 2x stronger—and second HUMAN. These guys aren’t robots, and because of that you can use that to your advantage. You need to show that you’ve thoroughly studied about the school (not just for prestige), will give them SOMETHING for letting you go there, and lastly (but most importantly) MOTIVATE them into REALLY REALLY WANTING YOU TO GET AN ACCEPTANCE—not wishing— WANTING. If they WANT you at that school, they’ll talk highly of you and convince others, this domino effect can honestly be strong enough to destroy a bad stat or two. That’s why the essays are powerful, but they’re only powerful if done EXTREMELY WELL. Write drafts, tens of hundreds, have only one or two editors preferably not someone who just says “such good writing” and preferably not family (but you decide) two at most. Then, right before, have someone you kind of know read it and tell them what they think they’ve learned about you (maybe old teacher you somewhat knew) and send that bad boy in!\n\nAlso, fyi, ALWAYS resolve your essays! Never end on a bad or even iffy note, the stronger the content the stronger the resolution—even if it’s not 100% resolved! “",
            "75%+ of your essay should be about growth or how you’ve changed as a person for the better. Instead describing the situation you should more so describe the impact it had on you and how you changed cause of it. You also can’t be arrogant or braggy about it (avoid saying things like “while other people” or “unlike most”).\n\n\nThe essay needs to be 100% about you, even if the topic is about say how another person changed you (this was my essay topic)",
            "though the essays seem daunting, it's still just a part of your application. that means whatever you write your essay on has to make relative sense in the context of your entire application as a whole. basically, what i mean is avoiding double-dipping topics for your supplementals and common app essay (aka having too much overlap between them). \n\nalso, a full-circle moment is a foolproof way to make your essay more memorable. set up a nice metaphor or structure at the beginning of your essay and return to it at the end to pack that extra punch.",
            "Talk like you’re the narrator in a Martin Scorsese movie (for example DiCaprio in Wall Street or De Niro in Irishman.) Perfect blend of casual and formal, conversational yet telling a story, and most importantly: it FEELS personal and amicable, which is the most important. If you don’t know what I mean, watch a Scorsese movie and pay attention to the narration. The writing is extremely engaging and famous for a reason.",
            "None of it was good",
            "Start early...get the first draft down on paper (you know what I mean).  It cannot get improved until it gets out of your head."

            "Wow! I've listened to your alumni interview advice video about 8-10 times now, just driving to and from different places. Was pleasantly surprised to your face when I clicked on the link. How soon do you guys begin interviewing students in the year? I'm curious about that timeline.",
            "What's the stupidest thing someone has done on an interview?",
            "Keep in mind that 5, \"is this an essay only I could write,\" doesn't mean that your essay needs to be wholly unique in every aspect! It's a common pitfall for applicants to think that they have nothing unique, and therefore good, to write about. But the essay doesn't need to be one that nobody else could write, just one that tells the reader about you in you in a way nobody else could.\n\nThis is your essay about you, what's going on in your mind, not your parent's (and what they *think* is going on!).",
            "This is good advice, particularly #3.  We don't care that you own a thesaurus.  We want to hear from you in *your* voice.  Our application contains a separate, very short writing section, and it's amazing how often it's clear that the person who wrote that 250-word statement is not the person who wrote the Common App essay.  We notice.\n\nI also like 6-10 a lot.  The topic isn't important.  We want to see that you're able to be reflective in an honest and objective way, and that you have the ability to articulate those reflections in a way that shows us how you changed as a person because of whatever thing you're telling us.  Also that you can form a logically organized essay, obviously.  That's going to be critical to anyone's success in college.\n\nDon't worry if you haven't experienced the same kind of adversity as one of your peers.  Colleges don't require that you have suffered sufficiently before admission.  As a father of three kids, I spend a disproportionate amount of my time making sure my kids *don't* experience the same kinds of things that happened to me at their age.  \n\nDon't try to elevate losing the state championship game to the level of a kid who lost a parent to a drunk driver.  They're both valid things to write about if you have something meaningful to say about how it affected you, and every student is going to have their own unique experiences.  Your experiences are who you are, and that's what we want to hear about.\n\nJust make sure it's YOU who writes this essay.  It's a good idea to have counselors and peers read it before you submit, and they often have very good advice about a tweak here and there, but before you click that Submit button you need to make sure it's *your* essay in *your* voice.",
            "Fantastic advice. It's about ideas derived from your unique experiences and not in crafting a smokescreen of idealized accomplishment. What have you learned? It's okay if they were ugly lessons - those are what distinguishes us. How we take in failure and our bad choices. Can you see the bigger picture?\n\nIt's really saddening to see so many posters here who shit on themselves for having nothing to write about. They ding themselves out without giving the validity of their own life experiences a chance. Kids who are quiet geniuses and kids who \"just do x,y,z,\" are denying themselves the right to be complicated and flawed. \n\nDamn, a lot of these posters don't realize that they are chock full of insights and experiences - they only have to sit and take the time to tease them out. \n\nThe pressure on 18 year olds to have the same constitution and social intelligence as a fucking 48 year old working professional is fucking disgusting. \n\nWe need to let teenagers be explorative and stupid. \n\nWhen I interview, I look for potential. I look for the seeds of insight and the ability for a student to really be okay with asking questions about the world around them.\n\nThis shit of expecting fucking 17 & 18 year olds to perform at a level they are not even developmentally equipped with yet needs to die.",
            "13 is soo true- there's a difference between a really good essay and a really good essay that will get you into selective schools.",
            "[deleted]",
            "> you want a brief description of what happened, and a DEEP dive into how it changed you. \n\nBut wouldn't that be telling and not showing?",
            "It says write about hardships and don’t gloss over them. I’ve dealt with a tough household for the majority of my life. Would it be wrong if me to talk about it or is it okay if it shows my determination?",
            "Would it be too personal or cliche if I talked about how I was bullied in middle school?\n\nI was repeatedly humiliated and ostracized for a few years because I was different, and it eventually left me feeling like I had no reason to live (btw, I went to a very small school in a small town and knew mostly the same kids for over 10 years. We went through elementary, middle school, and high school together. There was no other school to flee to, so I had to make do with what I had). I had no one to talk to as a human being-I never let my parents know I was the loser at school because I didn't want to let them down (in fact, I still have not told them to this day)-and if you've ever felt truly isolated you know that it's the lowest feeling that exists. However, my experience definitely helped to shape me into who I am today. I eventually recognized that no matter how far I fell, I could always bring myself back up. My differences weren't what my bullies said they were, they were me, so I began to embrace them along with my flaws. I learned to laugh at myself with my bullies, because I finally realized that nobody is perfect (especially me), and this surge of confidence made my bullies question their own motives. I suddenly started making friends because I finally had the ability to interact with people without hiding who I was inside. I realized that everyone deserves respect and someone to talk to, especially the people that society feels deserve it the least, and that every person has potential for growth. From this newfound discovery, I forgave my bullies for their transgressions. Were they not people with flaws, just as I was? \n\nWould this be an ok topic? I've been beating myself up over what to write about for the past few days. Let me know you guys' thoughts"

Check your inbox and if you're comfortable sharing, I will make sure this matters gets addressed appropriately and immediately.\n\nAgain, I am so sorry.

            "I am a high-end college adviser in Los Angeles. What you experienced is absolutely inappropriate and I would recommend writing a lengthy letter to Stanford admissions describing your experience. They will definitely want to know that one of their interviewers is acting this way. Be sure to mention the \"beautiful girl\" line, specifically. That is wildly unprofessional.\n\nIf you want to take a strong, principled stand, state firmly in your letter that you are rescinding your application from Stanford and would appreciate a refund of the application fee due to this experience. \n\nIf you do not decide to rescind your application, writing this letter well is likely to increase your admission chances, honestly. I'm sorry to hear that you had such a horrible experience :(.\n\nedit: read some replies. I agree that the guy is just an asshole and probably not a racist. He's clearly the type that enjoys acting smarter than everyone in the room. For future interviews, though, do make sure that you can explain your research in great detail without notes. That is pretty important, for what it's worth. And although I personally disagree with the tactic, it's entirely possible that other interviews at your chosen schools will *feel* hostile and challenging. Part of what this is intended to tease out is the both the strength and grace of your intellectual spine. That said, this guy is about five steps beyond anything resembling a line.",

If it helps you, use the experience as fuel to show those types up. Use it as an example of what never to become regardless of how successful you are (or think you are).

Some students in those discord groups are actually very happy to take a look at essays and comment on it (this should be a last resort however as you don’t know who these people or what their intentions are).\n\nAnother resource you could use which many comments also mentioned are asking TRUSTED family friends and school teachers/counselors for advice and feedback on essays. The reason why I say trusted is again it’s very easy for anyone to take your ideas or even your entire essay and plagiarize it hurting your sister’s chances. Always make sure it’s someone she knows well and trusts. \n\nOne final source I could give you is reading past essays and really getting into the mind of an admission officer (along with watching interviews of admission offciers) and understanding why those were so good and was liked by admission officers or did bad and wasn’t likable. This strategy takes some work if you’re not used to interpreting stuff from essays or don’t have a long attention span but it does give you a chance to think and view your essays from the reader who will most likely be speed-reading it. \n\nPersonally I would stay away from those generic “how to get into Harvard” videos and sites because they almost never address the luck factor of admissions and always make it seem that admissions is an easy process so long as you have the right stats which is ofc UNTRUE. \n\nI’m wishing the best for your sister, and I hope she comes out of this long tedious and arduous process with her goals achieved and her spirits high!",

It's an amazing school that really cares about its students. Pretty much all of us ( that I know) went onto grad school or became very successful.

Congratulations - this is a huge achievement!",
            "Getting a full ride as an International student to any university in the US is a huge accomplishment in and of itself. Vassar is also a highly respected school. To say he didn't get in because he is Indian and his parents are of Indian origin (but not of privilege) is complete non-sense.

Focus on the positive instead of wasting your time with this victim mentality.",

The only way you could be so terribly upset at not winning is if you had completely irrational expectations.\n\nOf course, knowing that doesn’t necessarily help a mother console her son, because telling him “you shouldn’t feel bad because you never should have expected to be admitted to Harvard in the first place” would the exact WRONG thing in this situation.\n\nThat said, you are correct that re-applying after a gap year is completely unlikely to yield a different outcome at Harvard (or any similar school) and would likely encourage even MORE inappropriate expectations — “This time I WILL have a chance.”\n\nPerhaps the move is to encourage him to start at Vassar with the best effort possible and be open to transferring somewhere else in a year or so? This may get him off in the right foot, wanting to succeed at Vassar, etc.  The worst case scenario is that he ends up liking Vassar and stays there.\n\nGood luck — and you’re a good mom for wanting to help him realize his dreams!"

Last is, she plays the harp (individually, via private lessons, not through school or in an orchestra.) Again, hard to figure out where she'd show leadership.\n\nWhat sort of things might you recommend? She will offer to be a TA for the younger kids at ballet next year - but does that count as leadership?

Does it connect to more specific things about you? More than likely, this topic isn't enough though: you would be better off tying in other parts about yourself—showing the values you have grown, what actions you've taken and roles you've embodied, and what new values you may develop to show admission officers insight about yourself.** Maybe talking about a trait is a good beginning to lead to more.\n\nHappy to discuss more!"

Read it attentively before trying to answer any of the questions so u arent wasting time by trying to find answers later. skimming can also cause confusion and mess up ur understanding of the tone and purpose of the questions ur answering. \n\n(Science) again, read the whole thing. Try to simplify what the studies and data tables represen/are talking about because it can be easy to get lost in the big words! Read it all first, understand it, and then you'll be able to answer quicker. \n\n(Writing) make a shoddy framework on your scrap paper. Try to compose it like a normal essay as well. Create topic sentences for each paragraph (2 bodies at least) and make sure you meet the requirements by checking them off as you go. Do a read over for simple stuff like capitalization and grammatical errors. I'd recommend doing an intro and conclusion even if they're tiny.  \n\nOverall, always identify what they are asking of you, what you are meant to be determining, and always make sure you understand the provided content before answering questions about it. \n\n(Sorry this is a bit long)"

Last piece of advice is sort of like on math, PLUG AND CHUG, plug each answer into the sentence and read it through, you can often hear which one sounds right (hence the speeches).

            "Hey! Got a 36 in reading in Sept. ‘24 and Feb. ‘25 and what helped me the most was reading the entire passage first, then answering the questions. A lot of the times the answer will be in the passage verbatim, so use questions like that to your advantage and don’t waste time on them, time being a VERY important aspect. I would suggest taking a few practice tests on CrackACT and trying this strategy. You don’t have to fully understand the passage whatsoever, it will just help you to know where to look which saves you time you might have spent rereading the same thing 100 times looking for the answer. If the answer isn’t readily available, I bookmark it and move on, coming back to deliberate on them later. Most of the time the answers that aren’t directly stated are easy enough to find through process of elimination. I really hope this helps you as much as it did me! I got a 21 on my first reading test but after utilizing this strategy I’m a “perfect” scorer (even though I did miss one question, admittedly). Good luck!",
            "My whole composite score is 30 (cuz I suck at math and science) but my reading is a 31. When I took the act on the reading section, I left the questions about the entirety of the passage for the end in each passage I was doing. I tried to answer only the questions asking about a specific section first, skimming the passage to find the info I needed. Once I got to the questions that did ask about the entire passage, if I didn’t get enough information from the past questions, I skimmed the whole passage to try and get an idea, or I just speed read it to get a better idea. I don’t know if anyone else does it this way, but that’s just how I did it. Hope this helps!",
            "34 reading. what really helped me with that 34 was that my high school teacher is very good, and gave us a huge emphasis on rhetorical analysis. i believe developing the skill of deeply understanding what the author is talking about on levels deeper than face value is what helped me get that score with genuinely zero preparation."

            "The ACT is indeed more straightforward. I wouldn't call SAT less logical though; wouldn't the less \"apparent\" questions on the SAT require more logic, and thus more logical? I would just take an ACT practice test and see how you do. Importantly, don't just focus on the numbers, but also how you feel about the two tests.\n\nThe ACT is indeed changing.

However, if you google to concordance table, you can see that a 36 on the SAT converts to a 1570-1600, Of course, if your extracurriculars, grades, essays, recs, etc. are lacking, then colleges would take the more involved 1560 (or even less) applicant over a \"study-only\" 1600.",

More people take that test so it might happen more often. But the hardest questions on the SAT are tougher than the hardest questions on the ACT. \n\nIf you asked me to rank the four scenarios you listed, I would go with:   \n1600 on SAT  \n36 on ACT (36.0)   \n36 on ACT (35.5)   \n1560 on SAT\n\nThese are all fantastic scores and none will be the cause of a student getting rejected.  \nThey alone are also not a guarantee of getting accepted",

Take a digital SAT practice and compare it to your ACT.  \n\nI started with a 26 ACT and got a 33 on my october and september. My biggest tip is to GRIND practice tests- and I think that goes for ACT and SAT. I’d focus on one subject per day, or per 3 days. Go through practice sections, review rules, see what I got wrong. For the ACT I mastered my calculator for math. For science, I mastered the patterns of questions and graph reading. For english , it’s really just recognizing the type of questions and being detailed (I know you said you tried to be non detailed) but detailed helps for questions that test dangling modifiers, punctuation and clauses. Reading- look at line reference questions first and answer. I never read any of the passages unless the comparison. \n\nJust my suggestion:) I wish you the best in whichever test you take!

ACT math might send you studying, lots of probability permutations and combinations problems. There’s some trigonometric stuff which I don’t remember seeing in the SAT but I thought that was fine. Science is just another reading section it’s making sure you read the experiment carefully and selecting the right answers. ACT english is just long but similar to SAT.",

            "We see a lot of posts this time of year with people wondering how to study/work/time manage in general better. I thought it would be useful to go over some ideas that can be lost in the shuffle. \n\nThis is especially useful for young students looking to develop good habits going into their first/second years. This will be long so I have **Bolded** the most important pieces. Some important ideas that don't appear because I felt like they are discussed a lot, but I could explain:\n\n**Time Management**\n\n**Studying**\n\n**Honesty**\n\n**Being Able to Say No**\n\n**Sleeping** Please sleep adequately it is detrimental to your body not to. **7-9 Hours** (3)\n\n\n**1: Diet/Fitness** - Your diet and fitness levels do no only change how you perform in sports situations. The stomach and diet related factors have been shown to influence mental health including depression and anxiety (1 and 2). \n\nWhat does this mean? You should be strict about what you eat if you want to perform at your best. Whatever diet you follow, it should be one that **makes you feel energized and healthy**. If you are constantly sick or under the weather or under energized these are signs of improper nutrition and fitness. \n\nFor fitness, incorporating moderate/heavy exercise into 4-5 days of your week can make a world of difference. Your body is much more resilient than a lot of people give themselves credit for. **This is a valuable lifelong endeavor and college is a great time to develop lifelong fitness habits.**\n\nSome big pitfalls can be lack of preparation for meals, lack of discipline with workout programs, and falling under negative peer influences. All of these issues are avoidable with proper planning and commitment, you answer to yourself with this topic. \n\n**2: Study Groups and Social Studying** - If you are going to spend 2-4 hours a day **studying this time will be much more enjoyable if there is a social element to at least part of it**. Forming peer groups of an appropriate size ideally within your major, especially once you've started with major specific classes. This group can be flexible and not everyone has to be at every session, but you should always have people you can rely on. \n\nIf you were to miss a class, you'll want to have people who can share notes/assignments/information from that class. The teaching/learning skills that you build in a group study team are incredibly important as well. It is quite common to realize that you don't fully understand something once you try and teach it to someone else and now you have a chance to brush up and get a more complete understanding. You may also find that **your friends are better at explaining certain ideas than the professor**, you can get a different view into a complex topic.  \n\nYour performances in classes is important and enjoying the studying is definitely possible. \n\n**3: Mentors and Confidants** - College can be a new and exciting, but also frightening world. Even the most mature young adults can benefit from insights from those who are more experienced in certain fields and experiences than they are. I wouldn't just limit this to class. **You should seek out advisors in each aspect of your career whether it be professional/research/social/classroom/leadership related.** I have found my experience with professors mentoring me through my major that it is a great feeling to just discuss everything that you are doing and take stock of the future. As a mentor myself, it is incredible to meet young people who are interested in something you are passionate about. I have found that my advisors/supervisors/mentors have always been incredible receptive to my questions/concerns/musing and I can't see myself where I am without them. \n\n**4: Accountability** - At the end of the day you have to answer to yourself for what you have done. Part of being able to reflect positively on your accomplishments is to recognize areas where you are coming up short and improve on them. I personally have had a lot of issues with expecting too much of myself sometimes, it can be difficult to find a balance. \n\nYou are the only person who's expectations matter, **improving on your past self** is a great marker for progress. **Superiority to others and perceived in-superiority cause fleeting happiness and lasting suffering**, neither of which are solid goals. You should have realistic expectations of how you want your present and future to go and adjust them as you go. **You have to decide when to hunker down and put in maximum effort.** What can you do now that will provide you with lasting fulfillment and satisfaction? \n\n**End** \n\nI am going to be doing some presentations in the fall at my university for students and I will probably post similar stuff on productivity/scheduling/networking and getting jobs and research positions if you guys are interested.

            "I ask a lot of questions in class and other students have literally come up to me to be like thanks for asking those questions. Freshman year is easy, but as you progress make sure you ask youre professors questions. Sometimes they come as not wanting to answer but you just need to keep pestering them.\n\nSome classes especially the really big ones, professors dont take questions during class but thats a case by case scenario. If you are in a big lecture hall and you sit in the big you need to basically scream if you want to ask a question and want the professor to hear it. No rules of going to class or not. Its like high school. You have the nerds in the front, the people who play games on their computers in the middle and those in the back that Im convinced dont even hear the professor based on how no sound ever reached the back. \n\nI think after your first day tomorrow, you wont be nervous whilst college is way way way harder the high school, its way more fun. High school teachers terrorize their students about college professors but they more chill than high school proffesors, at least some. My chem professor would let us out 30 min early every lecture but someone we were all still prepared for the common final",
            "First: since classes start tomorrow I would walk around campus. This will allow you to get more comfortable and you will be able to find your classes so 1 you won’t get lost and 2 you will get an understanding of how long it will take to get to each class. \n\n2: go to every class. It’s easier said than done. For most people after you skip 1 to many classes it’s like an addiction and you won’t go to any more classes. \n\n3: stay on top of things. Don’t procrastinate. Best advice for me is if you have a pretty big break between classes start doing school work for the class that you just finished. In my experience doing work from 10-12pm is horrible. The work you do from that time will not be the best quality, and all the work you did would only take you like 30 min after a nights rest. \n\n4: figure out a good study method. For me if the class is more math based then I do practice problems. If it’s more vocabulary based then I just make a Quizlet and test myself on it. \n\n5: I would recommend hand righting your notes. What I do is I will write everything on my laptop because some professors talk pretty fast, then when I get home I will hand right what I typed in a way that better understand it. \n\n6: go to office hours. Office hours are great. You get one on one time with your professors and it will help you learn a lot. I had a professor who sucked when it came to teaching a class, but was amazing when it came to one on one time. \n\n7: make class buddies. Talk to the people around you and see if they want to make a group chat. This can help when it comes to stuff like hw questions, study buddies, and if you do projects in the class you have people all ready set. \n\n8:Try to sit more towards the front of the class \n\nSome unspoken rules: try to not ask questions that will take too much time to answer. You should ask questions, but if you’re asking so many “easy” questions then people will get mad. Also after like the second class where you are sitting is where you sit the rest of the semester. It’s unassigned assigned seats.",
            "I'm sure you'll do fine. Just take a deep breath.\n\nLike with high school, that first week, you really aren't learning anything. Professors (especially for freshmen) understand that students still need to get textbooks and other materials, and everyone financial situation is different. To be honest, Covid made a lot of people realize that stuff happens all the time--cars break down, busses break down, a member in the family gets sick, etc....\n\nGet a chance to know your professors if it makes you feel comfortable. Stay back a few minutes to introduce yourself if you have time. \n\nTake time to read the syllabus for each class, and if you're able to, print them. Your college might give you an alloted amount of printing credits. \n\nCheck what classes you need to take for at least undergraduate, and if you know what your major is, your major college (ex. College of business, liberal arts) and the major itself. \n\nJust note that for some of the undergraduate studies, if your major is in a broader college, that college, there may be some classes you'd otherwise never take, in particular if you're a social science major, when it comes to the hard sciences. \n\nAsk questions to clarify and get tutoring if necessary. Many students tend to use GroupMe to set up classroom chats for notes, studying, test.datws, etc.., so definitely talk to classmates if you think that'll be useful.\n\nWhen it comes to taking notes, personally, I prefer handwriting notes because I have more control of what I write down (ex. Diagrams) but you can do whatever is comfortable. \n\nIf you have time, get to know the campus a little bit. If there're shortcuts to your classrooms, seek those out. \n\nJust remember you're not the only one, there're many that are starting their freshmen year. \n\nI'm sure you'll do well.",
            "1.  Select your seat on day 1 and try to sit there for the rest of the semester.  Each class, when there aren’t assigned seats, have “unassigned seats,” where most people will sit in the same place everyday.  Try not to move around too much or else you’ll be sitting in someone’s unassigned seat.\n\n2.  Do not ask to leave to go to the bathroom or anything like that.  Professors want to treat you like an adult.  If you need to leave, you can leave.  Don’t ask.\n\n3.  Try to get to know your professors.  Your professors aren’t roadblocks to success.  In fact, they’re actually gateways to many opportunities.  They can also be really fun people to talk to, as they’re huge nerds about their topic and can often share some pretty cool stuff about their subject, so I highly recommend chiming in office hours.\n\n4. You can’t just memorize your way through college.  My macro, micro, and managerial economics professor, the best professor I had in college, put it very well:  “in order to learn economics, you have to DO economics.” What he means is that to learn something, you have to actually practice with it.  I highly recommend using quizlet and kahoot to create practice exams based on your notes and practice there, as that’s what I did throughout college and it worked perfectly.\n\nHopefully these tips will help.  I just graduated back in May, so school is still fresh of my mind, although I have already started to lose some tips from it.  Good luck!",
            "go to the events they throw! even if they arent interesting, youre bound to get some free food and meet some people!",
            "Just remember that what you're going through, somebody else is as well.  If you have a question then somebody else does.  If you are stressed, lonely and scared, some others are feeling that as well especially during your first semester of school.",
            "Good luck! Starting college can be scary because it's a new experience, but it also sounds like you're overthinking it.\n\nDuring lectures, you typically take notes (on paper or laptop, depending on your preference/class. It's more acceptable for an English major at my college to take notes on paper during English classes, but most classes have it easier on laptops, for example), ask questions, do activities, etc. It's not too much different from high school, but you're held accountable for attending classes that aren't back-to-back. You can usually just leave to go to the bathroom (it makes me nervous, so I don't, but I've had classmates just say, \"need to use the bathroom,\" and leave. Some just leave and we all ignore it.) If you aren't at class for whatever reason, just send a quick email to the teacher letting them know, but some students don't even do that.\n\nOutside of class? Essentially, don't be an absolute idiot when around campus. Don't break laws, if your campus is a dry/drug free campus, don't bring any of that stuff on campus, don't do anything dangerous, don't harass people. In your dorm, when using a microwave/oven, pay attention to the instructions on the food you're making (my dorm has a problem with Freshmen burning popcorn in the microwave because they don't read the instructions and assume they know what they're doing). Pay attention to the laundry instructions and don't overload the washer/dryer-and don't let it sit, set a timer and switch laundry over/get it when it's time to do that. Shower often enough (PLEASE don't think you can cover up with perfume or cologne, it just smells like severe body odor mixed with it, I'd prefer someone just not bother). Wash your sheets. Have moving air in your dorm, whether open window, fans, open door, or a mix of the three (that's more just for your dorm, though). Don't walk into someone's dorm without permission, and if you accidentally do, apologize and move on (I had someone do that once, it was no big deal). Respect shared spaces, whether when studying elsewhere, your dorm with a roommate, the cafeteria (I work at my cafeteria and have had a guy pour syrup and chocolate milk all over the table and just watch me clean it up, trying to impress me by bringing up that we had a class together, did I remember what he said at class about his previous degree. I still talk about and mock him, will slap him if I ever see him again, but that's just a personal thing, if it had just been the table, I would have been annoyed but forgot about it).\n\nUltimately, no one is paying as much attention to you as you think, except maybe your friends, but you're also paying attention to them because they're your friends, so it evens out.",
            "Get comfortable in professor's office hours! That was the difference between an A and a B/C in several of my classes because they made exceptions based on perceived effort that they didn't make for students who didn't visit office hours.\n\nJoin clubs! Visit clubs even if you don't think you'll like it! The worst that happens is you decide not to join. Of course, don't do this to the detriment of your education, but as someone nearing graduation, my fondest memories and closest friends came from clubs, some of which I'm not even in anymore. You won't get another opportunity like it.\n\nTake lots of notes, make friends in classes even if it's just a \"working relationship\" (I let you see my notes when you're sick, you let me see yours when I'm sick). Doesn't have to be super deep.\n\nTry not to make enemies. Be assertive, stand up for yourself when need be, but don't go around pissing people off or burning bridges when you can help it because you'll be seeing these people around (and people they know) for a few years and you may need them sometime in a class you're struggling with or a club promotion. This is more for aquaintances- if it comes to real friendships, prioritize yourself over any of this and cut people off if needed for your own mental health. The people I thought would be my best friends after orientation are people I hardly see anymore, and many of the people I thought would be my core group went different ways than I did. I've had a few stick around since the beginning but they weren't the people I expected! \n\nKeep your safety in mind and carry pepper spray. Assaults can happen to anyone regardless of gender, stature, or weight. Cover your drinks if you party and if you're with people you don't know extremely well (and be wary even then). \n\nIf you want to drink, don't do it around midterms/finals except to celebrate after finals and don't do it before big tests. Drinking isn't necessary to a good time and I've had lots of fun without drinking, but I've also had fun doing it responsibly during school breaks and holidays. If you're the kind of person who gets addicted to things easily or succumbs to peer pressure, not drinking is also a good choice (nobody needs to know why, and claiming you can't for medical reasons will usually shut people up- if they push further then they're entitled and not worth your time anyways).\n\nDon't take 8 AMs unless you can help it for your first semester. You may think you can handle them since you did it in high school, but a lot changes in college and sooo many people make that mistake. I'm taking two 8-11 am classes this year and I'm already mourning my mornings :,). \n\nIf you can help it, don't get a job! Enjoy this time! I've worked all four years of college but did not begin working during the work week until my sophomore year (and during high school). It really has detracted a bit from the social aspect but having extra cash to pay bills, support my animal rescue habits, and hobbies has been worth it. If you want to get a job anyways, I wouldn't do it in the first semester so you can get a feel for your own limits.\n\nWhen you make friends, try to keep in mind that you may outgrow these people, and that's okay. I've shed some friendships I never expected and while I still miss them sometimes, you have to remember that growing and changing as a person often means different people need to be in your life. It doesn't have to be a formal breakup, but you may find yourself suddenly spending less time. \n\nTry to keep in touch with old friends as well. While there are people you'll probably outgrow, try not to neglect those who you HAVEN'T truly outgrown and have just not spent time with. I'm so much more fulfilled since I began pouring myself back into some of my older friendships and have cut back on \"fluff\" friendships that were not progressing beyond the surface level.\n\nOn that note, also know that surface level friendships are okay! Not every friend has to be your best friend ever. I have friends who I wouldn't go on vacation with but I'd wave at them in class and catch a quick lunch with them. We'll chat about something relevant and move on. I may not speak to these people when I graduate but they're still pleasant to be around and I enjoy my time with them! I know that they're likely to be in the group I outgrow once I graduate, but that *doesn't* mean it's a waste of time to be their friend. It just means we both understand that this may not be forever.\n\nI hope this all helps!! I've been doing a lot of reflection recently and these thoughts have been bouncing around in my brain for quite some time so it's nice to have a place to share them!",

            "first of all, it seems like given your mental health right now it would be a better idea to take a bit of a lighter load.\n\nsecond, as a very beginner student in a language course full of fluent students, please dont do that. just test out of the language requirement. it can make the class much harder for everyone who truly is a beginner, and youll be bored out of your mind. classes that bored me out of my mind were much harder than classes that were actually difficult but interesting. most language departments will switch you out of the 101 class if they find out you dont belong there anyway. pick a class youre actually suited for, that will interest you and keep your attention. the beginners will thank you:)",

The transition is fun but also difficult. On top of that, you're dealing with other personal issues which have a significant impact on your mental health. There's no reason to put so much on your plate right now.\n\nI would recommend dropping one of these classes now, and during the regular add/drop period during the semester test the waters and be prepared to drop another. After your first semester you can decide if you think a busier schedule would be doable.\n\nAlso, most universities won't let you take a beginner course in a language you aren't a beginner in.

Have a STEM degree and some tricks to share that saved me tons of suffering :)\n\nIt's totally fine to SIGN UP for that many. I regularly signed up for 1 more class than I wanted to take, so I could drop the one with a bad professor, that made my schedule too much to handle, or whatever else. I think my largest credit semester was 16. For context I was a bio major for 3 semesters then changed to computer science, so mostly stem courses and gen eds for me. \n\nI had a 4.2 GPA in high school and graduated with a 3.8 in college, and like others are saying - intro courses can be no joke. Some professors take it upon themselves to make them weed-out courses, or the department sets them up that way (physics 1 and gen bio 1/gen chem  1 are common for this). This is all just to give you some data - and was at a small private liberal arts school with solid STEM departments. \n\nOh also, it's SUPER common for labs to be listed as 1-3 hours long and regularly take MUCH longer than that to complete. Don't forget the lab reports etc that are added onto the homework & studying of the main course. \n\nYou know yourself, and by all means stay signed up for that many. But when syllabus week happens, take a close look at your professors and the course schedules/assignments/due dates/exam dates and **give yourself the leeway to drop something if it'll mean doing well in the rest of your courses.** \n\nSome things to look for from professors:\n\n* Has a schedule for exams/homework that's relatively set\n* Their sections weren't the last to fill of all the profs (most useful for freshman courses that often have several profs teaching different times)\n* Info you can get from upperclassmen doesn't list them as an \"avoid\" prof - yes ask them during the first week, the friendly ones are often in the study areas or common tables in the related building. RA's and other similar student leader type positions that aren't particularly academics related will often have solid info as well. \n* Decent office hours (smaller schools this is more applicable) and seem like they don't avoid students coming to them with questions\n* Isn't mainly a research prof, they're often forced to take a certain amount of courses on and are much less helpful/engaged/good at communicating (there are exceptions ofc)\n* There's tons more but they're much more school/department specific so I won't go into depth",

I suggest you create a spreadsheet/document with your total degree plan, including gen ed courses, major courses, electives, etc. and loosely create your schedule for the next 4 years.

The money is slim, but it beats paying for college. To be fair, though, you will still probably live in poverty. \n\nYou should also know the reality of this career. If you get a Ph.D., there are many more Ph.D.s than there are jobs. You will probably work as an adjunct for some time, and adjuncts are badly exploited, paid very little, with no benefits. Finding a full-time job isn't impossible, but it is difficult.

            "Focus on your studies, but make sure to say hello to the people around you. Don't drink if you can help it. If you do, keep it very light. Home in on your desired program early. 80% of first-years will change majors at least once. Don't be that guy and waste your time/ money/ effort. \n\nDon't date people you regularly cross paths with. If it gets messy, you'll have to deal with that. Start projects early. Don't put off assignments. Attend office hours and get to know your professors. You're not a child anymore, and while you should respect your professors as professionals, you no longer need to treat them like parental figures as you did in grade school. They are your educators, but they are adults like you. Give them respect and ask questions, but don't be afraid to connect with them personally. In turn, they may open doors for you, i.e. recommendation letters, jobs w/ connections in industry, internship/research opportunities, etc.\n\nBranch out. Always meet new people - even if you have a group. People come and go throughout life, and you only get so many opportunities to find others who you can relate to. Don't confine yourself to 5-10 close friends and settle. Keep reaching out and making those connections.\n\nDon't be late to class. Being early is on time. Being on time is late. Being late is inexcusable. Manage your time effectively. Stay off your phone during study sessions. Phones will rip and tug at your attention strings, and you won't be able to digest and retain information.\n\nCall mom and dad at least once a week or once every other week. Keep in touch with loved ones. They are here to support you through the good and the bad.\n\nJoin groups and clubs. Try new things. Don't be afraid to make mistakes or commit faux pas. It's a natural part of growing into adulthood and learning who you are.\n\nAsk questions! If you need help, don't be afraid to reach out! Step out of your comfort zone - that is where the most fun and growth are.\n\nHave fun!",

            "1. Get a fan. The dorms get HOT, and there isn't air conditioning. Get the fan, a cooling blanket, something. Fans also work for getting airflow in the dorm.\n\n2. Clubs. Join a club, multiple even. I started with six, I'm down to three. If someone hadn't convinced me to join a particular club, I wouldn't have even a fraction of the friends I have right now (the name was misleading). Sign up for as many as catch your eye, and show up to a meeting or two. No shame in not going, but, you know, you miss all the shots you don't take. \n\n3. Go to every single class you can. Email the teacher if you can't for whatever reason. It can get tempting since there's not really any consequence, but trust me, go.\n\n4. Read. Instructions. On. Everything. My dorm hall's upperclassmen HATE the start of the year because the fire alarm goes off so many times from people putting popcorn in for too long, leaving pizza in the oven until it's charcoal (I wish I was kidding, but I'd been in the shower when the alarm went off), overloading the washer. The fire department no longer rushes to make sure everything's alright, and no one's allowed back in until the fire department clears us. Sucks in December at 3 in the morning when they don't show up for an hour.\n\n5. Eat. Eat, eat, eat. Don't let yourself go hungry because the cafeteria scares you. Keep snacks in your room, get a  (college-approved) to-go box if they're offered, suck it up,  etc.\n\n6. Do NOT be afraid to see if you can switch your room if you have a roommate from Hell. A full-on health crisis (happened in my Freshman year) SUCKS when your roommate causes it and refuses to believe they're the problem. It took actual threats of throwing her shit out the window for her to stop...five asthma attacks and four months later. I hadn't had one since I was eleven. I was eighteen at the time. Of course, try to get along with your roommate, talk to them and try, but sometimes it IS a lost cause. Not everyone you meet belongs in college.\n\n7. SHOWER. Do NOT try to cover up with perfume or cologne. It just smells like BO mixed with it, and trust me, more people will notice and judge you if you try that than if you just walk around and own it, but people will still hate you. The showers won't kill you (although some people seem convinced that they will), so don't act like they will.\n\n8. Is it a dry campus? Don't sneak alcohol or drugs on. You might not get caught, but it's not worth the risk. When you're old enough (I'm from the US, not everyone reading this might be), go to the bar or an off-campus friend's house.\n\n9. Events. There will be a bunch on campus. Go to them and have fun. You don't have to go to all of them, but go to the ones you think sound cool. You can always leave early.\n\n10. Most importantly, have fun. Take a deep breath, relax, and have fun. College is an experience (I'm on my way via train to my senior year, super excited, but unfortunately can't sleep), and there will be ups and downs. When something bad happens, shrug it off and keep moving. For most people, it's their first time living on their own, so they mess up. Hell, everyone does. I still do. So nobody notices when you screw up as much as you do.",

            "1. I concur with other comment, a fan or a cooling device is a must. These dorms are gonna cook you alive\n\n2. dont skip class\n\n3. your mental health will be your downfall in college if you dont fix yourself straight; tells professors your struggles because getting it off your chest is important\n\n4. You should step up and be a leader and start forming friendship groups instead of waiting for people to invite you",

Its a good way to introduce yourself to the professor and for the professor to put a name to a face so you’re not just one of 100 kids they teach. It also helps show the professor you care.\n\nTo add to this, I would suggest only asking questions that demonstrate that you are paying attention and that you are interested in the course content. Don't ask questions just for the sake of asking questions, and definitely do not ask things that can easily be found in the syllabus/assignmemt instructions (you will not impress the professor if you do this)",

There's no harm in asking them!). A good advisor makes all the difference.",

            "I’d suggest starting with sociology since that’s already where you’re at, but take primarily gen-ed’s and one or two sociology courses. That way you can see if you enjoy the material, get to know professors, etc. without screwing yourself if you decide to switch majors (those gen-ed’s are going to transfer to any other degree you want, and there’s a decent chance even the sociology specific ones can count toward something)",
            "I would just worry about gen eds right now if you don’t know exactly what to pursue. While your taking gen eds do research on what you like and want to do. You can talk to your advisors about it as well. When I came to college I knew I wanted to study business, but I didn’t know what field I was going to pursue. So I just did research and as I was taking my gen eds I was able to find a class that I really enjoyed and I am now majoring in it."

            "Some know right away what they want to do and others it takes more time. I changed my major three times before I found what I was good at.\n\nRight now, you will be taking the basic courses, general ed. One thing you could do is take a couple of your gen ed courses until you figure out what you like and have a passion for. If you're not certain, then you can take a semester or two off and work and try and figure out what you would like to do. There's no shame in it. It's not always cut and dry for people \"I know what I want to major in\" because not everyone does.\n\nIf you find out college is not for you, that's okay. College is not for everyone. My oldest has already decided she doesn't want to go to college right away, maybe not at all. But she is taking a course at the technical center for what she knows she wants to do, Medical Assistant. So if you find college is not for you, just get a job and take time to figure things out. Also remember, technical centers are for adults, not just public school students. The cost for our technical center for a public school student is half the cost for adults. So that's something to look into and maybe consider. Many, many employers are looking for experience over a degree and many employers like both the degree plus the experience. \n\nSo give yourself some time and don't fret or sweat this too much. You will be okay."

            "I have a professor who said if there's a student who's sittin at like 78 (example), and they've participated, showed up to class on time, turned in the work- like genuinely did the best they can, and she feels like they deserve a B, she'll give it them.\nShe also has a book keeping track of students who help others, gone above and beyond and gives extra credit where its due.\n \nI wish I could say I dont think student will ask her because I can think of a handful that might not get the grade they want, but like I told her- some of them are just... special. 😂 she's tough but fair.",
            "If a professor is going to round up, they're going to do it for everyone, and they'll do so based on the overall grade distribution - asking won't make any difference to your grade (it will just, as the OP points out, piss them off and make sure they remember you for the wrong reasons). \n\nIf you want to influence a professor in your favor, just so happen to go to office hours with a couple coherent questions about the course material.",
            "\"I wouldn't even ask what you could do to boost your grade\" Yeah because 99 times out of 100 the answer is, \"There are about 50 things you \\*could\\* have done to boost your grade all semester. I'm not coming up with yet another assignment (and grading it) just to give you an extra, un-advertised 51st chance.\"",
            "Tbh, in some cases, this could even backfire on you. At my school, many classes have a professional category built into the grading scale. Usually only worth like 1% of total but the syllabus says if you beg for rounding or extra assignments, you'll get a zero for that category.",
            "It doesn't permanently damage your reputation with that prof.  \n\nWhat I'm mostly seeing is not students behaving badly when they do this, but students doing exactly what worked for them in high school. Apparently in high school you could pretty much ask for a shit ton of extra credit at the end of the year and turn in...something and pass the class. \n\nIt's not a student's fault that they're just doing what they've been taught works over the last 12 years, which is the majority of their lives.  \n\nWhat WILL get you on my naughty list is the not realizing that no means no. When I say 'no you can't do that', this is not an invitation to comment on my looks, imply that I don't care, or tell me that all semester you've thought I was garbage. It is also not a place to bargain.  A student emailed me today saying he would 'accept' a 10 point deduction off a paper that is 2 weeks late.  \n\nThe AUDACITY, I believe you young folks say.  \n\nI understand high school has taught a lot of young people terrible habits, and TikTok's 'oh it doesn't hurt to ask' (which is kind of a lie) reinforces it.  We're aware where it's coming from. It's not you, you've just been taught wrong.  College is about learning better ways and some of that doesn't occur in the classroom.",
            ">They will round up IF and ONLY if you put in the effort over the semester and they like you\n\nProf here. True, but it has nothing to do with whether I \"like\" you.",
            "don’t ask for extra credit at the end of the semester. I offer plenty of ‘regular credit’ throughout the semester. if you didn’t earn that, that’s on you.",
            "I do round up, but it's never been because someone asked. \n\"Ohh, I was going to give you a B+ for your 89.7, but now that I know that you would prefer an A-, I will definitely log back in and round it. Good thing you mentioned it to me.\"\n/s",
            "There is no \"blanket advice\" that works for every professor. Some will round, some will be annoyed, professors are human beings who have different views. If you really have a 79.6%, it doesn't sound like a letter of rec is even in the cards with them in the first place, so who cares if one professor thinks badly of you? Especially since you likely won't see them again."

            "I don't think time management is your only issue here to be honest...A couple things that seriously concern me from your post are the fact that you frequently forget to eat, barely sleep, have racing thoughts, are running on \"pure energy\", are constantly on the verge of panic, and feel as though you're barely making sense. None of that is normal, even for people who have severe time management issues.\n\nIf you're not exaggerating and this is an ongoing problem, I'd seriously consider contacting your school's mental health services ASAP. I am no psychologist, but what you describe sounds a lot like mania, which is a serious condition and one that warrants being seen by a professional. Even if that's not the issue, reaching out to somebody about this problem will help get you other academic support like tutoring, academic skills workshops, accommodations for classes, etc...Every university has resources like these, some of which might need a referral from the counseling/mental health services.\n\nIn the meanwhile, take a look at this definition and see what you think: The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania) touches on this, but a manic episode is described by the DSM-5 (basically the Bible of psychology) as:\n\n\"A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day.\n\nDuring the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:\n\n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.\n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep).\n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.\n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing.\n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.\n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).\n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).\"\n\nAgain, I do not mean to armchair diagnose you or suggest you internet diagnose yourself, you really would be best served talking to a professional. It's clear you realize you have a problem and I hope I could provide you some insight or that something I said resonated with you. Best wishes on getting some help!",

Give yourself plenty of time to study and work, but don’t let it bleed into personal time.

People do it on YouTube too with and without music so you could do it with them and then eat, take mini-naps, and relax over the breaks.

Create a plan. \nThis can be a schedule or something as simple as fridays are this class and saturdays are this class and friends are sundays. Best advice I got from the valedictorian. \"Do what's worth your time. It required self discipline to do the hard things you need help with but there isn't anything to learn from doing things you have down. After all there there to learn not do.\"\n\n2. Go to office hours. \nEasiest way to turn 6hrs of work into 2hrs is office hours. Professors are there to teach if they want to do research and have no time for students they should have gotten a research grant from industry or worked in a professional lab. They are professors first. Also no professor will be upset for dumb questions. After all the height of education know all to well sucking at something is the first step to being kinda good at something. Be brave be honest and trust they will help you. 12+ hrs is enough to ask for some help. \n\n3. Manage your expectations. \nNot everything will be perfect. Not everything will work out. Take it as a lesson for real engineering. You will never have all the time you want to make it something your proud af about. An old axiom I heard my freshman year a long time ago was \"the engineer who makes it perfect the first time will never work again\" I thought it meant something a lit like automation work smarter not harder. I quickly found out that that isn't the case do it enough. Worry about things worth worrying about. Big project spend some time on it. But don't finish it in one night. \n\n4. Make friends in class\nIt makes you go to class. First step to passing is showing up. Also engineering is no place for ego we all have to know all of the fundamentals and we end up in the same classes. Ask for help amd trust they might ask you. Return the favor and understand you need to know it it's not a competition of knowing fundamentals more. \n\n5. Its about learning not performing. \nTake it easy and try to be the best you can not more.",

You may need therapy or medicine to slow you down. You don’t have to deal with this alone and you shouldn’t. \n\nOnce I learned to prioritize eating and sleeping, I was able to get off the seizure meds and get back to a normal life. I still have some anxiety and a tendency to overwork myself, but I haven’t had a seizure in a decade. \n\nEat. Sleep. And if you can’t do that, you need help and that is ok.

But if they aren't helpful, it's not necessarily that they're being a jackass. They can be extremely limited in what they can actually do.",

Honestly, most professors are not knowledgeable as to how AI really works nowadays and are sensitive to anything that sounds like it. You should try to find evidence that you did not use ai. 1. find version history. IK if you used google docs you can find it and show your prof how you wrote it word for word. 2. (may not be as effective) show a document with your brainstorming process if you made one. 3. (may not be as effective) try chat gpt and give it the assignment prompt and use it to make your case that your assignment wasn't even close to similar to what gpt would write.",

I wanna tell you that when I took college algebra on all my tests I would explain each question with a paragraph written to show what’s going on, how I got there, which equations I use and how the equations even make sense. I used rulers to divide each question and probably looked like I was cheating especially on my final because I was the last person in the testing room. But if I could memorize that shit, literally explaining word for word what my textbook said to get to an equation and the whole purpose of what I was doing, then your teacher has a stick so far up her ass because she thinks that nobody could memorize the junk she pushes out her mouth. I have seen a post like this before and everyone said don’t admit to anything. Worst case scenario you did copy straight from the notes and can’t remember them at all but if you have somewhat of an idea what they mean, then she could literally test you on the stuff and you would do decent, that’s enough to prove that you weren’t straight up cheating and I doubt the college would agree to hurt you over that. I hope your teacher gets a well deserved awakening.",

            "First off, congratulations on graduating early - that’s a huge accomplishment!\n\nAbout the financial aid - take a deep breath! I went through the same anxiety when I started community college. Financial aid offices can be a bit slow, especially right before the semester starts when they’re swamped. As long as you’ve submitted your FAFSA and any requested documents, you’re probably fine. But here’s what I’d do: stop by the financial aid office during your campus visit (more on that in a second) and just politely ask about the status. Sometimes a face-to-face conversation can work wonders!\n\nAnd speaking of visiting campus early - YES, absolutely do this! It’s not only acceptable, it’s actually really smart. I wish someone had told me this when I started. Nothing’s worse than that first-day panic of running around trying to find your classes. Most community colleges actually expect and encourage students to familiarize themselves with the campus before classes start. Plus, the buildings are usually way less crowded, so you can explore in peace.\n\nPro tip: While you’re there, take photos of your class locations and maybe even walk your actual schedule route. Trust me, your future self will thank you! Also, check out where the important spots are - library, tutoring center, student services, and (of course) the best coffee spots.\n\nDon’t apologize for sounding “dumb” - these are all totally valid questions that pretty much every new college student has, whether they admit it or not. You’re actually ahead of the game by thinking about this stuff now!"

Did you talk to your professor before you let it go to 7? Attendance doesn’t have to be graded for you to fail. I would make sure that you’re fully informed before escalating this.

            ">Only thing on the syllabus about attendance was \" Students are allowed four absences during the semester. If students will miss more than four classes, the students have to report to the teacher as soon as possible to discuss the best steps to take to move forward.\"\n\nThe first sentence tells you the limit for this professors class, the second tell you what to do if you're likely to exceed that. While you're still in HS and technically a child, college students are, in theory, adults and are expected to act like it. If you had talked to him up front, or at least before he came to talk to you, you'd probably be in a different situation, but since you couldn't follow the requirement earlier, the \"best steps\" are now to not miss class at all or withdraw so you don't fail.",

Besides, as everyone else said, he mentioned 4 in the syllabus.... so it really was in the syllabus. It sucks that you stretched yourself thin and that the anxiety/depression is a hurdle for going to this class, but at the end of the day those are your responsibilities to handle. Not the professors to bend rules. College is going to be a lot more than just doing the bare minimum and getting passed like highschool is, please prepare for this moving forward.\n\nIf the class is really as useless as you feel than it should be no problem to just show up and zone out for the time, but you need to show up. This professor is being generous by extending you an opportunity to stay in the class and keep the grade, so just do it. The guy probably isn't an asshole, just talk with him about what's going on and be respectful and I'm sure he'll be understanding and try to figure a solution for you.",

And that might be something you should do. But accommodations are not retroactive, and will not magically solve your attendance issues. \n\nYou are spread too thin. You may be a really smart and overachieving student, but there are consequences to trying to do too much. I'm actually pretty surprised that a college is allowing a high school student take five classes in one semester as a dual enrollment student. Should raise some questions about the general quality of the college - 4 courses is a full load in college. I don't know why any advisor thought this was a good idea for you. \n\nThere's nothing to escalate here because there is a policy in the syllabus. Either start attending class or drop some of your course load."

Review notes and don't be afraid to ask questions! Depending on what type of learner you are, re-writing or organizing notes is a good way to review. Flashcards can be helpful for things like Bio where you have a lot of details to review. I also suggest doing practice questions to test your understanding of the content. I know that a lot of AP Chemistry builds on itself so it's so important to understand ideas and be able to apply them later on.\n\nAs it gets closer to the exam, take practice AP exams where you simulate exam day conditions: \n\n* free from distraction, quiet space\n* only use what you will be able to on test day (eg, calculator, periodic table, AP equation sheet for chem)\n* time allotted for the AP exam/SAT \n\nI hope this helps and best of luck to you on your exams!",

            "3. AP Seminar has the highest pass rate because college board wants students to pass the class so they can take AP research (the next class in the capstone program). The pass rate is super lenient so must students who barely try and students who somewhat try will end up getting the same score 3-4. A score of 5 is the rarest because you’d need to do extremely well on all of the performance tasks.",
            "I’ve noticed for a lot of hs they allow no prereq to APP1 > people unprepared don’t really care for the exam because most are seniors.

There are also very few labs in comparison to lets say AP bio where we have a lab almost every class for some units. Maybe it differs between schools though. A lot of AP 1 builds on itself though, so if you dont understand the basics you dont understand the whole rest of the courses fundamentals.",
            "For AP P1, most of the AP questions require you to understand multiple concepts from different units. For example, you might get a question asking you to solve for the rotational momentum of a mass attached to a string that’s spinning while also experiencing friction. If you don’t understand one unit you can fail a lot of questions. \nAlso, the AP test asks a lot of derivation based questions, and a lot of people struggle with that",
            "ap seminar was set up in a way where for you to pass, you just needed to do well on the exam and presentation part, and you can do whatever for the  the final,(my teacher told us 3 days before what we needed to do), basically it’s extremely easy to get 3/5 points, but to get a 5/5 you need to go above and beyond what a high school student would deem necessary.",
            "Pass rates are not at all indicative of difficulty. Iirc BC calc has a higher pass rate than AB calc. It comes down to who is taking the class. As other people stated with Chinese, if only Chinese speakers are taking it… yeah they’re going to pass. People who know they aren’t the best at math aren’t taking bc calc, only people who know they are good at math are doing that. So pass rates for classes that are known to be more difficult actually end up being higher in some cases because their reputation deters some of the lower end (sorry, can’t think of a better phrase) test takers away from them."

It's not like even AP Physics C which is similarly hard or even harder but if you're really good at math you can get by. In chem the math won't save you you actually have to understand the content.

I'd say since there's a little more memorization it might be easier than chem but still I wouldn't advise it if you don't have to.\n3. AP Comp Gov. Because of the way the exam is designed it would be hard to self-study because you need to understand a lot of stuff about the political systems of different countries and be able to write a bunch of essays etc. So doable if you're REALLY into it and you spend a lot of time reading about the politics and government of those countries. But I wouldn't.\n4. AP Stats. Some things are confusing but if you're good at math and you know the ins and outs of your calculator you it could be doable if you put in some effort.\n5. AP Lang. This one is weird because it's a decently hard class there's a lot of analysis etc, but you don't really use any class content in the actual exam so self-studying wouldn't be too hard. Just practice writing essays with past college board FRQs and the MCQs are basically the same as the SAT EBRW section so you should already be chilling. The only things the class is useful for are (1) getting someone to grade your essays. it's useful to have a teacher give you feedback and (2) building literary culture. for one of the three FRQs they don't give you content (argument essay) so you have to take evidence you know. So just follow the news, if you take any history class that's REALLY useful, but even just generally use content from your other classes as evidence. However, in class you would get to work on a lot of different texts which could come in handy to cite/refer to on the exam but as long as you read a lot outside of school (which hopefully you do, reading is great) you'll be fine.\n6. AP CSA. Honestly if you have any programming experience you already know most of the class. It's a breeze. If you don't it'll be a little more work but still really easy.\n7. AP Precalc. Since you're taking Honors Precalc it's the same content. But I wouldn't do it because it's a useless AP so Honors Precalc is the same, not need to self-study. But if you did, it would be super easy because you already know the stuff from Honors Precalc (which is broadly the same content).\n\nI'd say 1-3 don't, 4-6 sure, 7 don't (it's easiest but also will be of no use whatsoever)",
            "chemistry or bio in my opinion",
            "Don't take AP Precalc if you plan to take AP Calc, you're just wasting your money. Of the ones you listed AP Chem is probably the hardest to self study.",
            "chem. id say don't do it at all unless your career requires it.",
            "AP Seminar is one of the hardest to self study. You can only really know why it's so hard to self study if you've taken it. DONT SELF STUDY AP SEMINAR. Doubt you'd even want to cause it's college credits are shit",
            "Gov, Stats, and Language can all be pretty easily self-studies. There’s plenty of videos you can find online teaching them and none are that bad.\n\nBio is probably the hardest. The second half would be pretty easy to self-study, but the first is less so. Gonna be hard to find all the information necessary I’d imagine. 100% possible. But it’s probably the hardest\n\nOh and don’t take Ap Precalc. It’d be worthless. Not even sure if most colleges accept it as an elective",
            "I’d say \n1. Chem\n2. Stats\n3. Lang\n4. Bio\n5. Comp gov\n6. CSA\n7. Precalc",
            "Interesting to see Chem, Bio and Stats ranking in the top 5 consistently. What resources do you use to study, prepare and practice for these exams?",
            "1. AP Chem- hardest AP. Taking it right now. No. No. NO!!!\n\n2. AP Bio- lots of info. Hard to remember.\n\n3. AP CSA- it's computer science. Difficult to remember syntax, especially if you don't have computer science experience.\n\n4. AP Precalc- new AP. Not a lot of resources available.\n\n5. AP English Lang- grammar can be tricky especially due to countless exceptions of the grammar throughout English language.\n\n6. AP Stats- it's a math class\n\n7. AP Comp Gov- from what I've heard, really fun and easy AP"

It’s a 35 page booklet but it’s intensely helpful. I give it to all my students but I especially focus on it for my students who can only come up with fairly “boring” topics that won’t help to differentiate them from other students. \n\nOne thing I’d also add is that the common app topics tend to fall into two broad categories: your history/background and ideas that fascinate you. For kids who have “no story to tell” and “I’ve got no hook” but are otherwise smart and want to get into top schools especially, I think the “ideas that fascinate me”\ntopics are underrated. I had a student write an excellent one last year about quantum computing (make sure it’s still about *you* though). *Hacking the College Essay* mentions them a few times but I feel like they could have covered them more and talked through how students can develop those ideas. Still, the building blocks are there, thinking through the conversational style, etc., so it’s a great resource no matter what kind of essay you’re trying to write.\n\nAgain, it really helps increase your potential of writing a genuinely good rather than merely “fine”  essay.",

            "# 🌷 Senior Spring \n\nFINISH UP APPLICATIONS: Add any schools to your list that you need. There are plenty of colleges still accepting applications throughout the spring (and summer). I usually post a list throughout the spring on A2C.\n\nSUREFIRE SUREBET WELCOMING SCHOOL: Make sure you have a SureFire School. If you don't have one yet, look for good fits for you that are still accepting apps. Read above to see what that is if you don’t yet.\n\nSENIORITIS: I’m linking a couple of posts here. [The Cure for Senioritis -- and Other Admissions Stress.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kz8z5m/the_cure_for_senioritis_and_other_college/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Being rescinded for grade drops is a very real thing. Don’t panic about it, but you don’t want your average to drop more than 2 letter grades or so, you don’t want to make any Ds, and try to limit your Cs. [What You Really Need to Know about Being Rescinded.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ldzveq/happy_saturday_seniors_what_you_really_need_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nTAKE TIME TO CARE FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND YOUR BODY: Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Waiting for those acceptances can be brutal. Breathe. Acknowledge that once those little baby applications have flown away from your computer, you no longer have control. (see all my suggestions above for Taming the Admissions Stress Monster) [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nm9ywc/if_youre_feeling_stressed_out_about_college/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nEMOTIONAL PLANNING: Plan for the worst, but hope for the best. Recognize that many colleges you might be interested in are extremely selective, and even if they're not, they might be holistic. Don't get too bonded to any college except for your SureFire School. Keep in mind that there are far too many amazing yous to fit into the tiny teacup of colleges you’re all trying to squeeze yourselves into. [My Post about Emotional Planning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kagpbk/happy_thursday_beautiful_seniors_if_you_applied/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nGRATITUDE: Think about what you are grateful for. What are the good things in your life? Try to make a mental list every day. Be sure to write thank-you notes to all those who have helped you along the way: counselors, teachers, parents, admissions officers, and interviewers to name a few.\n\nENJOY THESE LAST FEW MONTHS OF HIGH SCHOOL: Connect with friends and family.\n\nWAITLISTED?: Write a LOCI.

I want to redeem myself and really take everything into my hands and commit myself to academics next year, as well as extracurriculars. I plan on taking AP Chem, AP Gov, and AP Stats for my Junior year. Along with Spanish IV, a mandatory social studies class, and two semester long english classes, I should have 6/8 blocks filled for each semester. I was hoping to keep it this way, to ensure I have enough time to meet with teachers as well as do work and not feel swamped aferschool. Would this count as a \"rigorous\" class setup? I'm afraid having two free blocks will devalue my workload/schedule and make it seem like a rather easy one. On the contrary, I'm afraid if I fill even one of those blocks, I might start struggling too much and grades will drop significantly. Can someone give me some advice?"

It’s a 35 page booklet but it’s intensely helpful. I give it to all my students but I especially focus on it for my students who can only come up with fairly “boring” topics that won’t help to differentiate them from other students. \n\nOne thing I’d also add is that the common app topics tend to fall into two broad categories: your history/background and ideas that fascinate you. For kids who have “no story to tell” and “I’ve got no hook” but are otherwise smart and want to get into top schools especially, I think the “ideas that fascinate me”\ntopics are underrated. I had a student write an excellent one last year about quantum computing (make sure it’s still about *you* though). *Hacking the College Essay* mentions them a few times but I feel like they could have covered them more and talked through how students can develop those ideas. Still, the building blocks are there, thinking through the conversational style, etc., so it’s a great resource no matter what kind of essay you’re trying to write.\n\nAgain, it really helps increase your potential of writing a genuinely good rather than merely “fine”  essay.",

Recognize that many colleges you might be interested in are extremely selective, and even if they're not, they might be holistic. Don't get too bonded to any college except for your SureFire School.

You say you like students to take four years of science, but I’m strongly considering dropping science for AP Stat.

I have a pretty low gpa (3.578) which should go up a tiny bit (realistically, 3.63ish), which has discouraged me greatly. I want to redeem myself and really take everything into my hands and commit myself to academics next year, as well as extracurriculars. I plan on taking AP Chem, AP Gov, and AP Stats for my Junior year. Along with Spanish IV, a mandatory social studies class, and two semester long english classes, I should have 6/8 blocks filled for each semester. I was hoping to keep it this way, to ensure I have enough time to meet with teachers as well as do work and not feel swamped aferschool. Would this count as a \"rigorous\" class setup? I'm afraid having two free blocks will devalue my workload/schedule and make it seem like a rather easy one. On the contrary, I'm afraid if I fill even one of those blocks, I might start struggling too much and grades will drop significantly. Can someone give me some advice?"

It’s a 35 page booklet but it’s intensely helpful. I give it to all my students but I especially focus on it for my students who can only come up with fairly “boring” topics that won’t help to differentiate them from other students. \n\nOne thing I’d also add is that the common app topics tend to fall into two broad categories: your history/background and ideas that fascinate you. For kids who have “no story to tell” and “I’ve got no hook” but are otherwise smart and want to get into top schools especially, I think the “ideas that fascinate me”\ntopics are underrated. I had a student write an excellent one last year about quantum computing (make sure it’s still about *you* though). *Hacking the College Essay* mentions them a few times but I feel like they could have covered them more and talked through how students can develop those ideas. Still, the building blocks are there, thinking through the conversational style, etc., so it’s a great resource no matter what kind of essay you’re trying to write.\n\nAgain, it really helps increase your potential of writing a genuinely good rather than merely “fine”  essay.",

            "# 🌷 Senior Spring \n\nFINISH UP APPLICATIONS: Add any schools to your list that you need. There are plenty of colleges still accepting applications throughout the spring (and summer). I usually post a list throughout the spring on A2C.\n\nSUREFIRE SUREBET WELCOMING SCHOOL: Make sure you have a SureFire School. If you don't have one yet, look for good fits for you that are still accepting apps. Read above to see what that is if you don’t yet.\n\nSENIORITIS: I’m linking a couple of posts here.

Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Waiting for those acceptances can be brutal. Breathe. Acknowledge that once those little baby applications have flown away from your computer, you no longer have control. (see all my suggestions above for Taming the Admissions Stress Monster) [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nm9ywc/if_youre_feeling_stressed_out_about_college/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nEMOTIONAL PLANNING: Plan for the worst, but hope for the best. Recognize that many colleges you might be interested in are extremely selective, and even if they're not, they might be holistic. Don't get too bonded to any college except for your SureFire School. Keep in mind that there are far too many amazing yous to fit into the tiny teacup of colleges you’re all trying to squeeze yourselves into.

I want to redeem myself and really take everything into my hands and commit myself to academics next year, as well as extracurriculars. I plan on taking AP Chem, AP Gov, and AP Stats for my Junior year. Along with Spanish IV, a mandatory social studies class, and two semester long english classes, I should have 6/8 blocks filled for each semester. I was hoping to keep it this way, to ensure I have enough time to meet with teachers as well as do work and not feel swamped aferschool. Would this count as a \"rigorous\" class setup? I'm afraid having two free blocks will devalue my workload/schedule and make it seem like a rather easy one. On the contrary, I'm afraid if I fill even one of those blocks, I might start struggling too much and grades will drop significantly. Can someone give me some advice?"

It’s a 35 page booklet but it’s intensely helpful. I give it to all my students but I especially focus on it for my students who can only come up with fairly “boring” topics that won’t help to differentiate them from other students. \n\nOne thing I’d also add is that the common app topics tend to fall into two broad categories: your history/background and ideas that fascinate you. For kids who have “no story to tell” and “I’ve got no hook” but are otherwise smart and want to get into top schools especially, I think the “ideas that fascinate me”\ntopics are underrated. I had a student write an excellent one last year about quantum computing (make sure it’s still about *you* though). *Hacking the College Essay* mentions them a few times but I feel like they could have covered them more and talked through how students can develop those ideas. Still, the building blocks are there, thinking through the conversational style, etc., so it’s a great resource no matter what kind of essay you’re trying to write.\n\nAgain, it really helps increase your potential of writing a genuinely good rather than merely “fine”  essay.",

            "# 🌷 Senior Spring \n\nFINISH UP APPLICATIONS: Add any schools to your list that you need. There are plenty of colleges still accepting applications throughout the spring (and summer). I usually post a list throughout the spring on A2C.\n\nSUREFIRE SUREBET WELCOMING SCHOOL: Make sure you have a SureFire School. If you don't have one yet, look for good fits for you that are still accepting apps. Read above to see what that is if you don’t yet.\n\nSENIORITIS: I’m linking a couple of posts here. [The Cure for Senioritis -- and Other Admissions Stress.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kz8z5m/the_cure_for_senioritis_and_other_college/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Being rescinded for grade drops is a very real thing. Don’t panic about it, but you don’t want your average to drop more than 2 letter grades or so, you don’t want to make any Ds, and try to limit your Cs. [What You Really Need to Know about Being Rescinded.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ldzveq/happy_saturday_seniors_what_you_really_need_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nTAKE TIME TO CARE FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND YOUR BODY: Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Waiting for those acceptances can be brutal. Breathe. Acknowledge that once those little baby applications have flown away from your computer, you no longer have control. (see all my suggestions above for Taming the Admissions Stress Monster) [Here's my post about Mental Health Awareness and Mindfulness in Admissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/nm9ywc/if_youre_feeling_stressed_out_about_college/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where you can read more about all the ways I suggest (and use) focusing on your mental health while being in the middle of your admissions experience.\n\nEMOTIONAL PLANNING: Plan for the worst, but hope for the best. Recognize that many colleges you might be interested in are extremely selective, and even if they're not, they might be holistic. Don't get too bonded to any college except for your SureFire School. Keep in mind that there are far too many amazing yous to fit into the tiny teacup of colleges you’re all trying to squeeze yourselves into. [My Post about Emotional Planning.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/kagpbk/happy_thursday_beautiful_seniors_if_you_applied/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nGRATITUDE: Think about what you are grateful for. What are the good things in your life? Try to make a mental list every day. Be sure to write thank-you notes to all those who have helped you along the way: counselors, teachers, parents, admissions officers, and interviewers to name a few.\n\nENJOY THESE LAST FEW MONTHS OF HIGH SCHOOL: Connect with friends and family.\n\nWAITLISTED?: Write a LOCI. [Here’s a post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/m4eyq3/faqs_and_top_tips_about_what_to_do_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)",

I've taken a language from 9-11th grade, and in 8th grade that counted for high school credit. However, I'm planning on dropping it next year, mostly because I don't like the class and I'm trying to focus more on science/medicine courses.

I thought that people can get A-'s and still have a shot at good schools like the T20s.",

            "Thanks for the writeup. I have a question about my courses next year (rising senior). You say you like students to take four years of science, but I’m strongly considering dropping science for AP Stat. I think it is more geared towards my potential major (business/economy) and will also lighten my workload as it is easier than the regular sciences. I also think it will give my GPA a boost. What do you think?",

            "I’d definitely recommend consulting your counsellor/college advisor once you start the actual application process!! my school requires students to use a specific form to request a letter of recommendation and to have our transcripts sent to schools, plus we have information sessions that talk about how to research schools, how to apply, and other good advice.\n\nI went to a different high school than my older siblings did, so the process was markedly different from what my parents had gotten used to. it was *so* helpful to stay up-to-date with my advisor so I could be ready for every step! obviously not every school will require/offer the same things, so it’s good to ask and find out what you can plan on.",

            "Hi, finishing up my sophomore year here. \n\nI'd love to ask a quick question. I have a pretty low gpa (3.578) which should go up a tiny bit (realistically, 3.63ish), which has discouraged me greatly. I want to redeem myself and really take everything into my hands and commit myself to academics next year, as well as extracurriculars. I plan on taking AP Chem, AP Gov, and AP Stats for my Junior year. Along with Spanish IV, a mandatory social studies class, and two semester long english classes, I should have 6/8 blocks filled for each semester. I was hoping to keep it this way, to ensure I have enough time to meet with teachers as well as do work and not feel swamped aferschool. Would this count as a \"rigorous\" class setup? I'm afraid having two free blocks will devalue my workload/schedule and make it seem like a rather easy one. On the contrary, I'm afraid if I fill even one of those blocks, I might start struggling too much and grades will drop significantly. Can someone give me some advice?"
